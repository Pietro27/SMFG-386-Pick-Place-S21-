### 2. Project Management
#### Executive Summary
As the world continues to advance technologically and almost everything containing computer components, the manufacturing of PCBs and their components needs to continue and evolve to keep up with the demand.
This project aims to design a robotic system to place components on a board. In addition to designing the system, the electronic construction and coding of the robot will be developed.

#### PM @ RD Project Preparation
The project manager will organize the team to ensure that requirements and deadlines are met. He will ensure that their in constant and clear communication between team members as to avoid any errors or delays.

#### Project Documentation and Preparation of Infrastructure
For this project, we plan to control the robot using an Arduino. The coding will be designed using CodeSys.
The CAD and physical structure of the robot were prepared for the team by our project advisor.

### 3. Requirements
#### 2.1 System Specific Requirements
2.1.1 Identify and engineer the HW and SW requirements
- Able to move in the X, Y, Z axis
- Able to lift a component securely and place it on a board gently

2.1.2 Identify and engineer the requirements of the fabrication
- A secure structure able to house the desired robot
- Location that will hold the board and desired components

#### 2.2 System Test Plan
2.2.1 Scenario Definition
- The scenario for this project would consist of a circuit board being placed on one base and the components on a different base. The robot would then come down, pick up the component, move up and over the board, come down, and gently place the component onto the board to then later be soldered.
